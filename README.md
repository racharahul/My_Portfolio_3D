# Interactive 3D Portfolio

This project is a unique and engaging personal portfolio built with React and Three.js. It features a 3D interactive word cloud for navigation, creating a memorable user experience.

## Project Status

**Current Stage:** In Development

This project is actively being developed. The core functionality is in place, but I am continuously working on adding new features, improving the user interface, and refining the overall experience.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Navigation:** A spherical word cloud powered by Three.js serves as the primary navigation, allowing users to explore different sections of the portfolio in a fun and interactive way.
- **Dynamic Content Loading:** Pages are loaded dynamically without refreshing the browser, providing a seamless and fast user experience.
- **Minimized 3D Scene:** When navigating to a page, the 3D scene minimizes to a circular icon in the corner, acting as a persistent navigation button to return to the main 3D view.
- **Responsive Design:** The portfolio is designed to be responsive and accessible on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Three.js:** A 3D graphics library that makes it easy to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
- **React Three Fiber:** A React renderer for Three.js, which simplifies the process of creating 3D scenes in React.
- **React Three Drei:** A collection of useful helpers and abstractions for React Three Fiber.
- **React Router:** A standard library for routing in React.
