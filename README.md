# Interactive 3D Portfolio

This project is a modern, visually engaging personal portfolio built with React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber. It features an interactive 3D word cloud for navigation, a bold hero section with a background image, and a responsive, professional design.

## Project Status

**Current Stage:** In Development

The portfolio is fully functional with a unique 3D navigation experience, dynamic content, and a polished UI. Recent improvements include a left-aligned hero section with direct text on the background image, a fixed minimized 3D navigation model, and enhanced responsiveness.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Navigation:** A spherical word cloud powered by Three.js and React Three Fiber, allowing users to explore portfolio sections in an immersive way.
- **Fixed Minimized 3D Model:** When navigating away from the home page, the 3D scene minimizes to a fixed circular icon in the corner, remaining visible and accessible while scrolling.
- **Bold Hero Section:** The landing page features a large background image with prominent, shadowed text and a clear call-to-action, providing an epic first impression.
- **Sectioned Info Cards:** Below the hero, three cards highlight web development, 3D/interactive, and DevOps skills, each with icons and links.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts seamlessly to all device sizes.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Navigation between pages is handled smoothly with React Router, without full page reloads.
