        <h2>Hi, I'm Rahul üëã</h2>
        <p>I'm an aspiring software engineer with a love for building scalable backend systems, experimenting with DevOps tools, and diving deep into real-world, hands-on projects.</p>

        <h2>My Learning Philosophy</h2>
        <p>My learning philosophy is simple: <strong>"Code. Break. Learn. Repeat."</strong> I thrive on building things from scratch, understanding the "why" behind the tech, and constantly exploring new ways to make things better.</p>
        
        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p>Whether it's containers, APIs, or full-stack development, I believe in learning by doing ‚Äî not just tutorials, but through building things that challenge me and teach me something new every day.</p>
        
        <h2>Beyond Coding</h2>
        <p>When I'm not debugging or deploying, you'll find me turning my curiosity into side projects that often start with a "what if?" and end with lessons I never saw coming.</p>
